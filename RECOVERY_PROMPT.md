The current task is to migrate the project to the DataHaven network. I have already analyzed the project structure and created a preliminary implementation plan. I am now waiting for the user to provide the documentation for the tools that will be used to work with the DataHaven network. Once I have this information, I will be able to create a more detailed plan and begin the migration process.
